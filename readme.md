> ðŸ¦‰The "Stick to me" plugin allows you to create exit-popups on your web page, so you can capture visitors just as they are about to leave. It is now fully compatible with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, with no jQuery dependency.

# How it Works

Stick-to-me tracks the user mouse movement and detects when to trigger the popup. See it in action on gif below.

## Customisation
Stick to me allows a few customisations. See options below.


| Property | Description | default |
|---|---|---|
| layer | Selector of your popup html | empty |
| fadespeed |Controls the speed of the fade animation | 400 |
| trigger | Where detection of exit intent takes place | top |
| delay | Delay before showing popup when exit intent is detected | 0 |
| interval | Interval between popups | 0 |
| maxamount | Maximum times the popup will be triggered | 0 = unlimited |

| debug | Enable Debug mode to display console messages | false |

## Debug Mode

The Stick to Me plugin includes a Debug mode that provides helpful console messages to understand the plugin's behavior. When Debug mode is enabled, you will see messages related to tracking movement, detecting intent, indicating direction, and firing the popup.

To enable Debug mode, set the `debug` option to `true` when initializing the plugin:

```js
const stickToMeInstance = stickToMe({
    layer: '#stickLayer',
    debug: true
});
```

When Debug mode is ON, console messages will be displayed to help you understand what is happening. When Debug mode is OFF, no console messages will be shown.
